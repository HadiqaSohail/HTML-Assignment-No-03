    <h3 id="diagnosis"><u>Disease Diagnosis</u></h3>
    <p> Artificial Intelligence helps doctors diagnose diseases more accurately and quickly. AI systems analyze medical images such as X-rays, CT scans, and MRI reports to detect problems at an early stage. This helps in identifying serious diseases like cancer and heart problems and improves  the chances of successful treatment.</p>
    <h3 id="treatment"><u>Smart Treatment</u></h3>
    <p>AI supports doctors in creating better treatment plans for patients. It studies patient history, medical reports, and symptoms to suggest suitable treatments. AI also helps in monitoring patient health and providing alerts in case of emergencies.</p>
    <h3 id="records"><u>Medical Records</u></h3>
    <p> Artificial Intelligence helps manage medical records in a digital and  organized way. AI systems store and analyze patient data securely, making it easier for doctors to access information quickly. This reduces paperwork and saves time in hospitals and clinics.</p>
    <h3 id="robots"><u>Medical Robots</u></h3>
    <p>  Medical robots powered by Artificial Intelligence are used in surgeries and patient care. These robots assist doctors in performing complex operations with high precision. AI robots are also used for patient  monitoring and rehabilitation support.</p>
    <h3 id="futurehealth"><u>Future of Healthcare</u></h3>
    <p>The future of healthcare will be strongly influenced by Artificial-Intelligence. AI will help create advanced medical systems, smart  hospitals, and better patient care solutions. In the coming years, AI will make healthcare services faster, safer, and more accessible  for everyone.</p>
