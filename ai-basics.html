<h3 id="definition"><u>What is AI</u></h3>
<p>  Artificial Intelligence, also known as AI, is the ability of machines and  computers to perform tasks that usually require human intelligence. These tasks include thinking, learning, problem-solving, decision-making, and    understanding language. AI systems are designed to analyze data and learn from experience. This helps machines improve their performance over time without human help.</p>
<h3 id="history"><u>History of AI</u></h3>
<p>  The idea of Artificial Intelligence started many years ago when scientists began thinking about creating intelligent machines. The term AI was first introduced in 1956. In the beginning, AI development was slow because oflimited technology. Today, with powerful computers and large data, AI has  grown rapidly and is used in many advanced applications around the world.</p>
<h3 id="types"><u>Types of AI</u></h3>
<p>  Artificial Intelligence is mainly divided into three types. The first type is Narrow AI, which is designed to perform a specific task such as voice assistants. The second type is General AI, which can perform any task like  a human, but it is still under development. The third type is Super AI, which is a future concept where machines will be smarter than humans.</p>
<h3 id="examples"><u>Examples of AI</u></h3>
<p>  Artificial Intelligence is used in many daily life applications. Examples include voice assistants like Siri and Google Assistant, face recognition systems, recommendation systems on shopping websites, and chatbots.  AI is also used in navigation apps, smart home devices, and onlinecustomer support systems.</p>
<h3 id="importance"><u>Importance of AI</u></h3>
<p>  Artificial Intelligence is very important because it helps make work easier, faster, and more accurate. AI helps reduce human effort and saves  time by automating tasks. It is useful in education, healthcare, business,   and technology. AI also helps in decision-making and improves productivity  in many industries.</p>
